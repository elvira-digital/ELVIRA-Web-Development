-- RLS Policy for Guests Table - Allow Guests to View Their Own Data
-- ============================================================================
-- This policy allows authenticated guests to view only their own record
-- from the guests table using their JWT token.

-- Enable RLS on guests table if not already enabled

-- Drop existing guest policies if they exist

-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Result
-- ============================================================================
-- You should see 5 policies:
-- 1. "Enable realtime for guests" - FOR SELECT (allows realtime broadcasting)
-- 2. "Guests can view their own data" - FOR SELECT (allows guests to see their record)
-- 3. "Guests can update their own data" - FOR UPDATE (allows guests to update their record)
-- 4. "Hotel staff can view all guests" - FOR SELECT (allows staff to see all guests)
-- 5. "Hotel staff can manage guests" - FOR ALL (allows staff to manage guests)
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- Testing
-- ============================================================================
-- As a guest:
-- SELECT * FROM guests WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- Should return only their own record
--
-- As hotel staff:
-- SELECT * FROM guests WHERE hotel_id = 'your-hotel-id';
-- Should return all guests for their hotel
